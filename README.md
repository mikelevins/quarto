# quarto

folio in Swift

**quarto** is an experiment in adapting the folio APIs for use in
  Swift. I've been tinkering with Swift lately and found that it's not
  horrible. I might actually like it. Functional idioms are a little
  more foreign to it than I'd ideally like, though, so I thought I'd
  experiment with constructing Swift versions of some of the idioms
  from folio.

This is experimental code. Don't expect it to be particularly
complete, efficient, or bug-free.
