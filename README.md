# quarto

**quarto** is an experimental framework in which some of the functional idioms of folio are expressed in Swift.

I've been tinkering with Swift for a short while and finding it not bad. I might even be starting to like it.

It's not a functional language, really, but we might say it's functional-friendly. It includes some features that make functional idioms reasonably comfortable to express, so I thought I'd see how much of folio I can manage in it.

**quarto** is strictly experimental at this stage. Please don't expect it to be fast, complete, or bug-free.
